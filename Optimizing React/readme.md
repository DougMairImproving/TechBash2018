# Session Overview
React is a powerful library that makes it easy to build, reason about, and organize HTML user interfaces. The library is very fast and efficient, but you can encounter issues at scale if you don't know what to look out for. In this session, we'll build a simple single page ReactJS app and explore how to use tools and libraries to measure and then optimize performance.
