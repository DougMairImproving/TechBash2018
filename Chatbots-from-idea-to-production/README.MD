# Session Overview
Chat bots are turning up everywhere. Helpdesks, ordering a pizza, ChatOps, everywhere you look there's chat bots being created. How do you create your own successful chat bot?

In this session Geert will explain how to build your own bots using .Net, C#, Azure and the Microsoft Bot Framework. During the session we will cover all areas involved in building a successful production ready bot. Starting from the initial idea to getting a prototype working as fast as possible to actually running it in production on channels such as skype, facebook or telegram.

After this session you'll be fully ready to build your own bot that will conquer the world (if Sarah Connor doesn't stop it)
